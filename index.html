   Recently I have been struggling with the current job market for the games industry. I have a degree in art and a masters in Game Development so I decided to use this to my advantage. I have been using task apps on my phone to help organise my life, I have found them useful for:
    <ul>
      <li> Organising tasks. </li>
      <li> Setting task priorities. </li>
      <li> Planning out my day/week. </li>
      <li> Getting control of my life just a little bit at a time. </li>
    </ul>
    While using these apps there were a few features I found lacking and one feature that I thought would make the whole process a lot more enjoyable. I wanted to add a virtual pet to my task app so add an element of fun and whimsy to my day. I was a lover of the old tamagotchis as a kid and have a couple for nostalgia even as an adult so I wanted to customise and create the perfect task app for me. This is what lead to my idea for ‘Seagoals’

  The idea for this app is a task app with a virtual pet seagull that you can feed, play with and dress up. You would complete tasks to earn coins to buy costumes, food, toys and more fun items to spice up the app. Since I have an art background I have already jumped into designing the little seagull with some fun ideas for outfits but I needed to learn how to make the app. I was recommended CYF by UC as a starting point for this and Im using what ive learned so far to make a simple webpage for my game.

  Here’s to the future and I hope it will be fruitful.
